            <h1>What is Clinical Data Management?</h1>
            <p><span class="term">Clinical Data Management (CDM)</span> is the process of collecting, processing and
                safeguarding data produced by
                clinical trials and medical research studies.</p>
            <p>Reliable and accurate data is crucial for drawing accurate conclusions from clinical trials. Without
                high-quality data, the results of a clinical research study wouldn't be trustworthy, potentially leading
                tomisleading conclusions and jeopardizing patient safety.</p>
            <p>Essentially, CDM acts as the bridge between data generation and meaningful analysis in clinical research.
                By ensuring data quality and integrity, CDM professionals contribute significantly to the validity and
                reliability of research findings. This ultimately leads to more robust medical evidence for developing
                new treatments and improving patient care.</p>
